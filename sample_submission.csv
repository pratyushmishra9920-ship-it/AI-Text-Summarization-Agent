Summary,"Model Context Protocols (MCPs) mark a critical evolution in AI, shifting models from isolated, passive text generators to active, tool-using agents capable of orchestrating external tools, databases, APIs, and other AI systems. This transformative capability addresses the limitations of internal context windows and facilitates seamless integration of external knowledge and real-world actions. MCPs are deemed essential for the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), providing AI with long-term memory, verifiable knowledge, and executable actions that current standalone models lack. They enable sophisticated multi-agent collaboration, defining a modular, extensible, and data-grounded architecture crucial for scalable AGI systems. This convergence is poised to become the foundation for safe, reliable AGI by ensuring transparency and alignment with human intentions."
